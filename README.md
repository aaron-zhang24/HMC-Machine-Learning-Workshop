# Machine-Learning-Workshop
Skills and datasets I worked with during the multi-week machine learning/data science workshop

Attended 5 week Machine Learning and Data Science workshop hosted by Aashita Kesarwani. Weekly material covered and datasets worked with are in folders labeled from session 201 to 205. 

The first couple weeks invovled using the Python pandas library to extrapolate and manipulate datasets such as airplane crash data and become familiar with the tools that data scientists may use when combing through datasets. 

The second half of the workshops focused more on machine learning and neural networks using Keras API and backend from TensorFlow. We used this libraries to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, which after analyzing text from thousands of movie reviews, our neural network was able to decipher whether or not a movie review was positive or negative.
